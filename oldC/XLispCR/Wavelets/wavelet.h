//   Header file for wavelet codevoid WaveletDecomp (double *x, long *pn, double *cLo, long *pk, double *wave);/* 	Returns wavelet coefs in vector wave; also uses the wave vector 	for temp space.  Scaling coefs are in vector cLo of length k.  Uses the 	global space cHi for storing the high pass qmf coefs.  	 	NOTE:  x is messed up at the end of this call.*/void WaveletRecon (double *wave, long *pn, double *cLo, long *pk, double *x);/* 	Reconstructs the data series into vector x of length n using the reconstruction 	input in the vector wave. "leading edge" of the wave vector holds the most 	recent low frequency (scaling function) terms. 	 	NOTE:  The wave vector is altered by this function as the calculations progress.*/void ThresholdWavelet (double *wave, long *pn, long *pSkip, double *pLevel, long *pMethod);/* 	Thresholds the wavelet vector wave (in place, arg altered) skipping skip levels	of the wavelet.  If method is zero, uses hard thresholding; otherwise, soft.*/
