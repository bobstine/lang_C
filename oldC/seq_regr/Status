The calibration variable has huge mean and variance. Something wrong in the calculations.


Check spline code when input data is not sorted (7/20)
... The sorting happens when the unique values of X are found and weights
    added up.  I also fixed a bug; the y values were not averaged when
    ties were found in the x's.

Add ability to drop last predictor to logistic regression (remove_last_predictor, 7/19)
... Fix problems with convergence by restoring the prior coefficient.
    Use the restore_state function to trim accumulating data and related
    data back to prior size.  Iterations converge more rapidly, with less
    damage from collinearity.

Long-term improvements to implement

How to allocate vectors dynamically.

Use gsl-iterators rather than loops.

Test for a linearly redundant predictor to avoid singularity in the addition of a
new predictor to the model.
