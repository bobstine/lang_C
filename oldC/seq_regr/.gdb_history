I would like to find some time in your schedule to talk about a project here at Wharton.
I have been working with Jerry Wind and several members of the Wharton Graduate Association to find ways to help MBA students get a better sense of the courses that are offered.
One idea that is now in place lets students update their Outlook calendars with a list of deliverables for different courses in the core.  It find it helpful.
I think that we could improve this tool by linking it to course syllabi.  I understand that WCIT keeps a directory of links to the different course syllabi.  If that, then we could build these links into the Outlook data.  That way, students could just click on a link get to the syllabus (which presumably would have more content information).
A second task that is in the design stage (so to speak) is to help MBA students identify courses to sign up for when it is time for them to register for the next semester.  I have used data from Anjanithe courses taken by past graduates to build several examples of typical sets of courses.  For example, a student whoclasses might be interested in the courses taken by other students who also took these in the past.
Rather than just offer a list of courses, this sort of recommender system would be more useful if it could offer a range of content.  At a fairly high level, the system could offer a list of links to the same syllabus database and the WGAT survey results.  For those who want more, it might be useful to allow students to look at the material from WebCafe.  
Moreover, rather than replicate all of the curriculum, it might be useful to have some way for students to search WebCafe to find courses that cover a topic of interest. I am guessing that there are reasons for keeping the WebCafe confined to those who take courses (such as restricting those who can participate in discussions or polls), but it seems a shame not to have some way for students to be able search for topics of interest.
Please let me know when we can talk about these ideas.
Thanks
Bob
