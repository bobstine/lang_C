Loader finds two versions of a function...

	The likely cause is that a function has been defined
	in a header file and is not inlined or a template
	function.

	Sometimes the link order will cause this to occur as
	well; change that in the description of the target.


Dubugger says "not enough frames on stack" and points to weird line

	An object is being used that no longer exists.  This will
	happen, for example, if a pointer that held by an object
	is deleted by someone else.

	Another source of this problem is an object that holds const&
	to an object, but the object was created in a function and
	goes away when the function exits.
