|
| Method of making files and running c5.0 
|
| .names
|    	get name's list of names (cauchy:/data/bank/old/big-merge-names.lsp)
|	change them to this format (notice the Y is listed twice, and listed as categorical)
|       the following is useful to figure out what values a column uses in column 140:
|       head -1 merge.data ; head -5000 merge.data | cut -f140 -d"," | sort | uniq
|
| .data
|	grab the estimation data file, delete weights, convert blanks to commas
|	head -582000 merge.all_data |sed -e"s/(/ /g" | cut -d " " -f3- | sed -e"s/ /,/g;s/)//g;s/,NA,/,?,/g;s/,NA,/,?,/g" >! merge.data
|
| .cost
|
|       since we have stripped out the cost, lets put it back in
|
|		predicted, true : cost
|		0,	0	:0
|		1,	1	:0
|		0,	1	:1
|		1,	0	:1
|
|
| .test
|
|	grab the testing data file, delete weights, convert blanks to commas
|	tail -2328000 merge.all_data | ... |  merge.test
|
|
| Now generate the actual output using boosting (-b = boosting):
|
|       c5.0 -f merge -b
