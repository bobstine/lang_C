Experts combine the features of a bidder with those of a stream.  The
expert serves as a host class, enforcing certain procedural rules.
It's up to the user to make sure that the bidder and stream are
compatible.

The auction only 'sees' the experts and does not interact with the
bidder or stream of features directly.

A bidder assigns a bid to the output of a stream of candidate features
that can be used as explanatory variables in the auction.  Each stream
includes a typedef of its result type.  Some will be features, some
will be collections of features.  The expert never holds the features
explicitly.  It leaves them in the stream until a bid is accepted and
then it pops the feature off of the stream.
