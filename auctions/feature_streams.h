 Feature streams implement an abstract protocol and deliver upon request the 'next'
 feature.  The regulator template wrapper-class enforce the common protocol for
 checking whether the stream is (a) empty and (b) has a non-trivial feature (eg,
 one that is not a constant).  Template objects in the feature stream object
 provide the data source that the stream uses to build the supplied features.
 These might be a model, a list of variables, a file, and so forth.

 Feature streams (along with bidders) are held in experts that participate in the
 auction. Experts call
 
        has_feature()
	
 before placing any bids.  The regulated class stream coordinates a sequence of
 calls to primitive methods and handles access to a source of changing collections
 of features via the call to

        can_make_more_features(accepted, rejected)

 The stream must not store these lists of features and can only access them
 during this call. If the stream has/makes a feature, then a winning expert will
 call
 
        pop()

 which must return a feature vector.  pop() must (a) run very fast and (b)
 return a vector of features.  Heavy lifting required in order to be able to
 pop() must be done in the method build_next_feature().  Certain classes of
 bidders in the calling expert may ask for the number of remaining features in
 order to determine how much to bid.  In order to support such bidding, the
 stream will need to implement

        number_remaining()
 
 Stream properties...
    Streams should be *lightweight*.  They will be copied heavily in the auction.
    Basically act as a stack/queue, a type of iterator really.  The stream itself
    does *not* hold data, just the rules to build new variables.

    Indexing. Some streams use indices to keep track of their position in a list
    of base features.  These indices should refer to the current head feature or
    the most recent head.

 Types of streams ...
    Finite           chooses variables from a fixed set of columns as a queue
    Fit              builds features depending on state of model (such as just added var)
    Interaction      interactions among features from a source of fixed size
    Feature-product  interactions between a feature and a fixed set (counts down, as vars in model)
    Cross-product    interactions between fixed set of features and a set of increasing size
    Lag              lags of a given feature
    Polynomial       bundle of several powers at once
    Subspace         several variables as a bundle

/*
  A regulated stream injects the method 'has_feature' into a stream object.
  That stream object must implement the three functions empty,
  current_feature_is_ok and build_next_feature.  The stream will then have the
  chance participate in the auction and submit a feature to the model via 'pop'.

  The regulated stream provides a 'consistent interface' for all streams without needing
  an abstract base class.  (Works since never have a collection of streams; streams are
  hidden in experts, for which we *do* have an abstract base class.)
