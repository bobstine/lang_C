DATA:
-----

To use previous existing data you can check it out using CVS.  They
live on gosset:/cvs/cvs in a module called data.  For example:

cvs -d ":ext:foster@gosset.wharton.upenn.edu:/cvs/cvs" co data

is how I would grab them.


USER CODE:
----------

To use the system, you have to first 

	(1) find some data and drop it into "data/foo/.../data" (or somewhere similar)
	(2) write a program (say convert_foo) to convert it to "bob" format
	(3) add the following line to the make file:

foo.dir/data:  data/foo/.../data convert_foo
	-mkdir $(@D)
	cat $< | convert_foo > $@


SYSTEM USAGE:
-------------

To use the system try "make foo.5forward.summary" to generate the
results from a 5-fold cross-validation analysis of your data.  Other
targets would be:

	make foo.5forward.summary
	make foo.10forward.summary
	make foo.5reverse.summary
	make foo.10reverse.summary

If you want to replicate your results on different folds, the
following should work:

	make foo.A.5forward.summary
	make foo.B.5forward.summary
	make foo.C.5forward.summary
	make foo.D.5forward.summary
	
If you want more than 5 replications, you will need to edit the
Makefile.  (It is obvious what to do.)  

LOG FILES
---------

	Each time you edit a program file all of the output files are
rebuilt.  Since you often want to compare to previous runs, there is a
running_log file.  The name is something like:

	foo.dir/5forward.summary.running_log

This file will have the last round of 5forward.summary in it.  It will
also have a single copy of a log file in it.  (In particular, a copy
of foo.dir/0of5forward/log.)

Some useful commands are:

	grep -A3 -B500 Arguments 5forward.summary.running_log  > short_summary
	tail -500 >> short_summary

This shorten the file drastically and sitll leave most of what a
typical user would care to ever look at.

	egrep "^SSE|Area|Id|^1 " 5forward.summary.running_log

This will grab all the key summary statistics.  Note that the run Id
comes after the statistics:


SSE = 356.816 LL = -1082.61
Area under ROC curve is approximately 0.951458
1    251 261 512

THE FILE STRUCTURE
------------------

Here is an outline of the file structure.  Directories end with /.
Links end with @.  Important files that the user might want to look at
are marked with a ==> flag.
