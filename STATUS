TODO

* Get auction to take advantage of the use of options in the names of variables, so 
  that it will be able to block the categorical variables and recognize that these
  are a 'bundle' and not try to interact them and so that it will know about missing
  indicators.

* Get auction to be able to open multiple files.

* Convert data from column form to row form (opposite of the transpose function).

* Implement sequential version of batch selection.  Make an external recommender that can
  run 'over' the sequential code, picking the next variable 'endogenously', a sort of 
  illegal recommender that uses the Y variable to pick it's next choice 'dishonestly.' Seems
  like it would be easy to just loop over the other variables externally.
	
* Port the old batch regression code to use selection weights.  Prefer prior factorization in
  which there's an engine that adds/evaluates a variable. 

* Test the use of selection weights using MBA exam results.

* Implement selection weights in the logistic regression code.



DONE

   Figure out how to rebuild applications that stand alone. Build products up in the 
   xcode.build director.  Need to include paths to the header files.  Thought that this 
   was easier?

5 Jan 07

   Get the data from the last MBA exam into 'JMP format' so that can convert it into a file
   suitable for running through the sequential regression program, using the selection weights
   option.
