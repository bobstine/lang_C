Pipes appear to break pretty often, esp for longer series.  May run
better with binary data rather than text?

Loop coder needs to rescale threshold estimates back up.

Try to see if I can get dyn-load method to work for c++ files.  Have
it running for c files, but not with the addition of STL function
calls.

Try this method to avoid the breaking pipes.

Run the new loop encoder in the wavelet application with some test
data.  Revise the code that formerly called the so-called initial
adaptive code methods.

24 Apr 00  -----------------------------------------------------

Revise the definitions in thresholding to 'tune' using only
a vector as input rather than the entire input deque.

Plug Encoder into the wavelet thresholding functions in
thresholding.cc.  Running OK in the test of the thresholding
objects.

Work on fixing the interface problems

	- coding with zero and one probabilities set to 1/n^2
	  (avoids the discontinuity of length near ends)
	  so have to fix interface of Encoder class.

	- private constructor/friend allow use of empty declaration
	  to declare an Encoder prior to search for best


19 Apr 00  ------------------------------------------------------

Code is running.  Needs tests.

Add monotone codes from lisp testing to cc.

Move the coding functions to coding.cc, coding.h and put just 
the encoding object that translates coefs to integer codes as 
the encoder object.
